# Razor Pizza Shop - Summary

In this module, I examined the Razor Pages architecture in an ASP.NET Core app. This app provided a UI for updating and deleting product listings exposed through a web API endpoint. I added a product creation form, taking advantage of Razor Tag Helpers. With Tag Helpers, I quickly added client-side and server-side validation. It also has cross-site antiforgery validation. I coded its PageModel class that provided a separation of concern for the page's logic operations and data properties.
